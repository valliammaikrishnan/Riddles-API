/* when you create a new project folder, create all the necessary folder and files inside it.
      First intialize npm using: npm init
      Then you will see package.json file
    next install all the npm dependencies using:
    npm i <npm package name> eg: npm i express ejs axios
    Then you will see node_modules folder
    and dependencies added to package.json
    Then Every time a change is made here, server has to be restarted.
Instead install nodemon , which will automatically restart the application(index.js), when a change is made.
Use -g to globally install, so you can use in other folders/projects
 npm i -g nodemon  ( to install nodemon globally)
 nodemon index.js ( instead of node index.js - to run the application)*/
